        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; Today, when a person is convicted of a crime, a system
        of legislation takes effect, limiting that person’s
        employment, housing, and education opportunities. This
        system is often referred to as “collateral consequences.”
        But these consequences aren’t collateral or secondary.
        They deny people their fair chance at a good life. And they
        aren’t consequences of a crime—they are unjust
        punishment of people who have already served their time.
        We call this a system of perpetual punishment. </p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; 47,000 laws today restrict access to employment,
        housing, loans, business licenses, education, and public
        benefits for those who have been convicted of a
        crime—even after they have served their sentence, or even
        if they were never incarcerated. Being subjected to this
        system of laws has been called a form of civil death,
        stripping people of their role in civil life. And the
        convoluted nature of these laws means that even those
        who work in the system—like judges and lawyers—cannot
        adequately counsel defendants who may plead guilty
        before understanding the full ramifications of their actions.</p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; This system keeps people from rejoining society,
        rebuilding their lives, supporting their families. We believe
        in something more: a society that gives fair second
        chances, where everyone who seeks to work, tvo learn,
        and to live a good life can. We work to give everyone a fair
        chance at living a good life. Join us in our work to end
        perpetual punishment.</p>
