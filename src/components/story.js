        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; In December 2017, Michael “Zaki” Smith got a letter
        from the NJ Board of Education that would change his life
        forever. After 15 years dedicated to mentoring young
        people, Zaki was barred from working at Eastside High
        School in Newark, NJ where he had been working for the
        past 4 years. This wasn’t due to his performance. It was
        due to his record. </p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; After a routine background check, Zaki’s position was
        eliminated due to his time in prison—15 years earlier.
        Beyond Eastside High, he would legally never be able to
        work in a New Jersey school ever again. When trying to
        make sense of what had happened, Zaki discovered two
        words that he had never heard before—but had affected
        his life since his first plea deal: collateral consequences.</p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; Collateral consequences are a legal term for the lifetime
        of perpetual punishment an individual continues to receive
        well after they have served their time—or even have just
        been arrested.</p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; The moment an individual pleads guilty to a crime,
        collateral consequences legally limit that person’s job
        prospects, housing options, educational options—as well
        as their ability to support their own families. They prohibit
        an individual from receiving a fair chance for rehabilitation
        after prison. The most distressing part is that collateral
        consequences are never mentioned as part of the
        court process.</p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; Zaki launched The Fair Chance Project to raise
        awareness about the 47,000 “collateral consequences”
        laws affecting formerly incarcerated individuals &#38; their
        families across the U.S., with the goal of dismantling them.</p>

        <p className="infoText is-size-6-mobile">&#x2192; The Fair Chance Project hosts the Feast for Fair
        Chances, community dinners where we promote both
        education about collateral consequences laws and
        discussion about what it means to have a fair chance.
        We encourage individuals to write to their local and state
        lawmakers demanding collateral consequence reform.</p>
