    <p className="bottom-margin">In December 2017, Michael “Zaki” Smith was
      let go from his job at a New Jersey school
      after four years of dedicated service and
      impact—not because of his performance, but
      because of his past criminal record. Zaki had
      spent 15 years working with and inspiring the
      lives of young people, but because of a
      conviction that was over 10 years old, he
      would never legally be able to work in a New
      Jersey school ever again.
    </p>
    <p className="bottom-margin">
    Zaki launched The Fair Chance Project in
    2018 to raise awareness about the 44,000
    “collateral consequences” laws affecting the
    70 to 100 million Americans who have a
    criminal record.

      Perpetual Punishment.
